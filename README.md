### Setup

**Clone it!**<br>
* Hit the green "Code" button and copy the SSH link.
* Then, in your terminal type "git clone" (no quotes) and then paste the SSH link you copied.

* After the intall finishes, run `npm start` and copy the link provided `http://localhost:8080/` and paste into your browser.
* Now that you have that visit this [GitHub](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and clone it down into a seperate folder outside of the one you previously cloned.
* Then, CD into the folder and run `npm install` and then `npm start`
* No need to copy and paste anything from this.
* The website should be functioning now!

### Challenges and Reflections:
* This project was a pretty difficult challenge. I dealt with fetching API data from the server and also enabling the ability to POST a new trip and then be able to fetch that data. Above that was creating a login page (which I have never done before), linking that login to the user, and then displaying that user's trips.
* Looking back at the start, I knew I needed to create different classes, but after that, I hadn't the faintest idea.
* After chipping away little by litte, referencing countless ways to overcome an error, getting help from fellow developers, and riding that emotional rollercoaster I came out the otherside with a product that I'm both proud of, and learned a great deal from.

### Future Iterations:
* Display a countdown to the user's next trip (if any)
* Add Travel Agent user to be able to approve pending requests from the user, search user by name, and total income generated.
* Allow the travel agent to create new destinations (see Endpoints table above)
